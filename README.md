# Beyond "Above and Below"

Beyond Above and Below (Baab) is a project to be able to share and collaborate on new encounters for the board game "Above and Below."

# Why?

Encounters involve interacting with a random scenario. An attempt to handle the random nature of encounters is made by the game by creating cards with each number and having the player roll a dice to determine the encounter. This works alright, but the expansions make it hard to add scenarios without making things clumsy.

A better solution would be to have an app that randomly chooses a scenario from a master list of available scenarios. Not only does this improve upon the original gameplay for selecting an encounter, but then it hides the rewards from all players, only revealing the reward for the chosen decision.

An app also allows players to come up with their own encounters and share them with other players.
